open Utility->Lodgerequest.swift->  insert api key used by tester in the let API_KEY, the one being used there has been deactivated.

# How long did you spend completing the assignment? How (if at all) would you change your solution if you had more time?

The main part of the project was completed in a couple of evenings (maybe 10 hours) i would make it a bit more aesthetically pleasing.

# Can you describe a feature (perhaps with some reference code) that exists in your chosen programming language that you found particularly useful?

the Json decoder works well, and desearlizing it into structures makes utalising the api data easy

# How would you track down a performance issue with yours or another developer's code?
I have had errors with my own which have been resolved by setting break points prints and watching changes in certain variables and functions to resolve the issue, a good bit of practise is to have your own custom error structure for errors you could pre predict to find the errors easier.
