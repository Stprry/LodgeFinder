How to run:
open Utility->Lodgerequest.swift-> line 16 insert api key used by tester.

I cannot seem to get the data to load into the tableview.


How long did you spend completing the assignment? How (if at all) would you change your solution if you had more time?
The main part of the project was completed in a couple of evenings (maybe 8 hours) with the issue im having persisting throughout the day

Can you describe a feature (perhaps with some reference code) that exists in your chosen programming language that you found particularly useful?
the Json decoder works pretty well when you can get it working, for me im struggling to get it to show the data in the table views at the moment

How would you track down a performance issue with yours or another developer's code?
I have tried breakpoints, prints but just cannot seem to find the error.
